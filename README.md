# angular-json

## Requirements

Tool | Tested in previous version
---- | --------------------------
PHP >= 5.4.x | No
Node.js >= 0.12.x | No

Separation of concerns is important. We will use Bower for all front-end dependencies and node for back-end. [Here is a good] (http://juristr.com/blog/2014/08/node-grunt-yeoman-bower/) article explaining the differences.

## To-Do

1. Fix highlightjs issue - currently there is a conflict with ngSanitize and/or ng-bind-html
2. Comfirm usage of bower for bourbon and bourbon neat
